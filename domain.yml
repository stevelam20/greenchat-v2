## GENERAL

  utter_chatbooster/booster_intro:
  - text: "Booster pump is to increase high flow low pressure water jetting
          
          It provides the extra boost needed to bring fluid pressure to the desire level"
          
    image: "https://i.imgur.com/Y6xxsDB.jpg"
  utter_chatbooster/booster_types:
  - text: "There are three types of booster pump pressure to achieve
  
          \n 1) 10 Bar
          \n 2) 15 Bar
          \n 3) 20 Bar"
  utter_chatbooster/deploy_booster_pump:
  - text: Booster pump is use for tank cleaning operations.
          \nIt is to connect to the gamma jet/sprinkle system that will be attached on the top of the tank.
          \nBesides that, you may also use as a pump to transfer less hazardous products.
  utter_chatbooster/booster_operator:
  - text: Booster pump is not a complicated machine to operate
          \nThere are not many procedure to operate a booster pump.
          \nThus, the booster pump operator is able to operate without any specific training program.
          \nFor better understanding, Booster Pump operator must go through the introduction video.
  utter_chatbooster/booster_material_usage:
  - text: "Water is recommended for the usage \n
          \n Oil/corrossive material are not recommended as it will damage the internal part of the machine and shorten the life span of the machine
          \n It is advisable to verify the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) before using the booster pump."

  utter_chatbooster/booster_speed_lever:
  - text: Speed lever is a means of controlling an engine's power by regulating the amount of fuel or air intake.
          \nBooster pump operator can increase or decrease the power of the engine by adjusting the speed lever.
          \nTo maintain the booster pump pressure, the speed leverl is to slide to the desired pressure and lock it by tightening the but.
