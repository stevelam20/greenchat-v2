      Every length of vacuum truck hose requires yearly hydrostatic test, where it is tested on its strength and for leak.
      Upon passing the test, the hose will be issued with a certificate.
      **Consult Greenchem Admin Team on the vendor performing the hydrostatic test.**
  utter_chatvac/vac_tank_cleaning:
  - text: |-
      Regular cleaning of the vacuum truck tank is necessary to prevent build-up of hardened sludge or when the tank was used to hold corrosive liquid.
      - Frequency of cleaning depends on rate of use and last item stored in the tank.
      - Cleaning can also be necessary to ensure tank is empty before deploying the vacuum truck for certain special job.
      - Cleaning is done in Greenchem facility and should only be performed by trained personnel.
